AZ 100.1 - Manage Azure Subscriptions and Resources

**Lab: Manage Azure Subscriptions and Resources **

Estimated Time: 60 minutes

All tasks in this lab are performed from the Azure portal (including a
PowerShell Cloud Shell session)

**Note**: If you are not using the Cloud Shell you will need to install
the Azure PowerShell module -
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-
azurerm-ps?view=azurermps-6.12.0. You will also need to authenticate to
Azure.

**Note**: Although not required, it is a good idea to deprovision any
existing resources when you have completed the lab. This will help
mitigate the risk of exceeding the default vCPU quota limits.

Lab files: none

**Scenario **

Adatum Corporation wants to use Azure Role Based Access Control and
Azure Policy to control provisioning and management of their Azure
resources. It also wants to be able to automate and track provisioning
and management tasks.

**Objectives **

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-   Configure delegation of provisioning and management of Azure
    resources by using built-in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles
    and built-in Azure policies

-   Verify delegation by provisioning Azure resources as a delegated
    admin and auditing provisioning events

> Exercise 1: Configure delegation of provisioning and management of
> Azure resources by using built-in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
> roles and built-in Azure policies
>
> The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:
>
> 1\. Create Azure Active Directory (AD) users and groups\
> 2. Create Azure resource groups\
> 3. Delegate management of an Azure resource group via a built-in RBAC
> role

4\. Assign a built-in Azure policy to an Azure resource group

Task 1: Create Azure AD users and groups

1.  Start Microsoft Edge, browse to the Azure portal at
    **https://portal.azure.com** and sign in.

> **Note:** You will need a Microsoft account that has the Owner role in
> the Azure subscription you intend to use in this lab and is a Global
> Administrator of the Azure AD tenant associated with that
> subscription.

2.  In the Azure portal, navigate to the Azure AD tenant blade

3.  From the Azure AD tenant blade, navigate to the custom domain names
    blade

> and identify the primary DNS domain name associated the Azure AD
> tenant.
>
> Note its value - you will need it later in this task.

4.  From the Azure AD custom domain names blade, navigate to the
    **Users - All **

> **users** blade.

5.  From the **Users - All users** blade, create a new user with the
    following

> settings:

o Name: **aaduser100011\
**o User name: **aaduser100011@**\<DNS-domain-name\> where \<DNS-

domain-name\> represents the primary DNS domain name you identified

earlier in this task.\
o Profile: **Not configured\
**o Properties: **Default\
**o Groups: **0 groups selected\
**o Directory role: **User\
**o Password: select the checkbox **Show Password** and note the string

appearing in the **Password** text box. You will need it later in this
lab.

6.  From the **Users - All users** blade, navigate to the **Groups - All
    groups **

> blade.

7.  From the **Groups - All groups** blade, create a new group with the
    following

> settings:

o Group type: **Security\
**o Group name: **az1001 Contributors\
**o Group description: **az1001 Contributors** o Membership type:
**Assigned\
**o Members: **aaduser100011 **

Task 2: Create Azure resource groups

1.  In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Resource groups** blade.

2.  From the **Resource groups** blade, create the first resource group
    with the

> following settings:

![page2image35384192](media/image1.png){width="2.0965277777777778in"
height="1.4583333333333334e-2in"}

o Resource group name: **az1000101-RG\
**o Subscription: the name of the subscription you are using in this
lab\
o Resource group location: the name of the Azure region which is closest

to the lab location and where you can provision Azure VMs. **Note**: To
identify Azure regions available in your subscription, refer to

**https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/offers/ **

3\. From the **Resource groups** blade, create the second resource group
with the following settings:

o Resource group name: **az1000102-RG\
**o Subscription: the name of the subscription you selected in the
previous

step\
o Resource group location: the name of the Azure region you selected in

the previous step

Task 3: Delegate management of an Azure resource group via a built-in
RBAC role

1.  In the Azure portal, from the **Resource groups** blade, navigate to
    the **az1000101-RG** blade.

2.  From the **az1000101-RG** blade, display its **Access control
    (IAM)** blade.

3.  From the **az1000101-RG - Access control (IAM)** blade, display the
    **Add **

> **role assignment** blade.

4.  From the **Add role assignment** blade, create the following role
    assignment:

o Role: **Contributor\
**o Assign access to: **Azure AD user, group, or service principal** o
Select: **az1001 Contributors **

Task 4: Assign a built-in Azure policy to an Azure resource group

1\. From the **az1000101-RG** blade, display its **Policies** blade.\
2. From the **Policy - Compliance** blade, display the **Assign policy**
blade. 3. Assign the policy with the following settings:

o Scope: **az1000101-RG\
**o Exclusions: leave the entry blank\
o Policy definition: **Allowed virtual machine SKUs\
**o Assignment name: **Allowed virtual machine SKUs\
**o Description: **Allowed selected virtual machine SKUs **

**(Standard\_DS1\_v2) **

o Assigned by: leave the entry set to its default value o Allowed SKUs:
**Standard\_DS1\_v2\
**o Create a Managed Identity: leave the entry blank

height="1.4583333333333334e-2in"}

**Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have created an Azure
AD user and an Azure AD group, created two Azure resource groups,
delegated management of the first Azure resource group via the built-in
Azure VM Contributor RBAC role, and assigned to the same resource group
the built-in Azure policy restricting SKUs that can be used for Azure
VMs.

Exercise 2: Verify delegation by provisioning Azure resources as a
delegated admin and auditing provisioning events

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.  Identify an available DNS name for an Azure VM deployment

2.  Attempt an automated deployment of a policy non-compliant Azure VM
    as a

> delegated admin

3.  Perform an automated deployment of a policy compliant Azure VM as a

> delegated admin

4.  Review Azure Activity Log events corresponding to Azure VM
    deployments

Task 1: Identify an available DNS name for an Azure VM deployment

1\. From the Azure Portal, start a PowerShell session in the Cloud Shell.

**Note**: If this is the first time you are launching the Cloud Shell in
the current Azure subscription, you will be asked to create an Azure
file share to persist Cloud Shell files. If so, accept the defaults,
which will result in creation of a storage account in an automatically
generated resource group.

2.  In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command, substituting the
    placeholder \<custom-label\> with any string which is likely to be
    unique and the placeholder \<location-of-az1000101-RG\> with the
    name of the Azure region in which you created the **az1000101-RG**
    resource group.

3.  Run this command:

4.  Test-AzureRmDnsAvailability -DomainNameLabel \<custom-

5.  label\> -Location \'\<location-of-az1000101-RG\>\'

6.  Verify that the command returned **True**. If not, rerun the same
    command with a different value of the \<custom-label\> until the
    command returns **True**.

7.  Note the value of the \<custom-label\> that resulted in the
    successful outcome. You will need it in the next task.

8.  Run these commands:

9.  Register-AzureRmResourceProvider --ProviderNamespace

10. Microsoft.Network

Register-AzureRmResourceProvider --ProviderNamespace

Microsoft.Compute

**Note**: These cmdlets register the Azure Resource Manager
Microsoft.Network and Microsoft.Compute resource providers. This is a
one-time operation (per subscription) required when using Azure Resource
Manager templates to deploy resources managed by these resource
providers (if these resource providers have not been yet registered).

Task 2: Attempt an automated deployment of a policy non-compliant Azure
VM as a delegated admin

1.  Launch another browser window in the Private mode.

2.  In the new browser window, navigate to the Azure portal and sign in
    using the

> user account you created in the previous exercise. When prompted,
> change
>
> the password to a new value.

3.  In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Resource groups** blade and
    note that

> you can view only the resource group **az1000101-RG**.

4.  In the Azure portal, navigate to the **New** blade.

5.  From the **New** blade, search Azure Marketplace for **Template
    deployment**.

6.  Use the list of search results to navigate to the **Custom
    deployment** blade.

7.  On the **Custom deployment** blade, in the **Load a GitHub
    quickstart **

> **template** drop-down list, select the **101-vm-simple-linux** entry
> and
>
> navigate to the **Edit template** blade.

8.  On the **Edit template** blade, navigate to the **Variables**
    section and locate

> the **vmSize** entry.

9\. Note that the template is using hard-coded **Standard\_A1** VM size.
10.Discard any changes you might have made to the template and navigate
to

the **Deploy a simple Ubuntu Linux VM** blade.\
11.From the **Deploy a simple Ubuntu Linux VM** blade, initiate a
template

deployment with the following settings:\
o Subscription: the same subscription you selected in the previous

exercise\
o Resource group: **az1000101-RG\
**o Location: the name of the Azure region which you selected in the

previous exercise\
o Admin Username: **Student\
**o Admin Password: **Pa55w.rd1234\
**o Dns Label Prefix: the \<custom-label\> you identified in the
previous task o Ubuntu OS Version: accept the default value\
o Location: accept the default value

**Note**: You will not be able to proceed with the deployment due to
validation errors. This is expected, since you are attempting to deploy
an Azure VM of which the size

does not comply with the policy you assigned to the resource group
**az1000101- RG**. You can confirm this by navigating from the **Deploy
a sample Ubuntu Linux VM** blade to the **Errors** blade and reviewing
the error details.

Task 3: Perform an automated deployment of a policy compliant Azure VM
as a delegated admin

1.  From the **Deploy a simple Ubuntu Linux VM** blade, navigate to the
    **Edit template** blade.

2.  On the **Edit template** blade, navigate back to the **Variables**
    section and locate the **vmSize** entry.

3.  Replace the value **Standard\_A1** with **Standard\_DS1\_v2** and
    save the change.

4.  Initiate a deployment again. Note that this time validation is
    successful.

5.  Do not wait for the deployment to complete but proceed to the next
    task.

Task 4: Review Azure Activity Log events corresponding to Azure VM
deployments

1.  Switch to the browser window that you used in the previous exercise.

2.  In the Azure portal, navigate to the **az1000101-RG** resource group
    blade.

3.  From the **az1000101-RG** resource group blade, display its
    **Activity log **

> blade.

4.  In the list of operations, note the ones corresponding to the failed
    and

> successful validation events.

5.  Refresh the view of the blade and observe events corresponding to
    the Azure

> VM provisioning, including the final one representing the successful
> deployment.

**Note**: The deployment might fail if the **Standard\_DS1\_v2** Azure
VM size is not available in the region in which you created the
**az1000101-RG** resource group. If this happens, you might try
rerunning the lab and creating the **az1000101-RG** resource group in a
different region.

**Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have identified an
available DNS name for an Azure VM deployment, attempted an automated
deployment of a policy non-compliant Azure VM as a delegated admin,
performed an automated deployment of a policy compliant Azure VM as the
same delegated admin, and reviewed Azure Activity Log entries
corresponding to both Azure VM deployments.
